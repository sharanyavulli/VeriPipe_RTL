# VeriPipe_RTL
VeriPipe: Verified Pipeline Controller (RTL)  VeriPipe is a unified pipeline controller with formal verification. It manages control signals, handles hazards, and ensures instruction atomicity. Implemented in Verilog, it features HLS-based scheduling, control dependency graphs, and CTL/LTL verification via model checking for robust pipelines.
